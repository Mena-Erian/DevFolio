# DevFolio - Bootstrap Training Project

In this step of my learning journey that has never and will never end, I built DevFolio as a personal portfolio website to practice Bootstrap. This project marks my transition from learning pure CSS to using CSS frameworks. It focuses on mastering Bootstrap's grid system, utilities, and components while maintaining a clean and professional design. I worked **mobile-first** to ensure a responsive experience on all devices and used **a little JavaScript** to create an animated counter that activates when it comes into view.
